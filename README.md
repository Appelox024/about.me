A little more about me

Hey Y'all

A little introduction about me, myself, and I. Currently following a development traineeship at Newskool (www.Newskool.nl). I'm interested in taking on projects concerning web development. NewSkool is a detaching agency that specializes in IT. If you are interested in this proposition feel free to visit the following link: https://www.newskool.nl/traineeship. I'm currently studying for a bachelor's in IT with a focus on software development.  My interest in Software development began when I started my first online business where I sold ties. I couldn't get the website the look exactly the way that I wanted it to. And I've been on this journey for a year now.

My goal is to help small businesses with their branding and online presence through websites and design. I'd like to increase sales and engagement for small businesses so they can increase their profits. I have an interest in UX/UI design and like to learn more about this specific subject. Currently, I am focused on HTML/CSS and most of my time currently is on learning JavsScript. My strengths are I am willing to learn and work hard. I think in solutions, not problems and I am very detail oriented.
